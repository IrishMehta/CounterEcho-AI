He’ll be sending them to die in a globalist campaign.
If to Palestine they have to march off to fight his war,
They’ll be adding genocide to their bloody battle score.

Shell-shocked and wounded soldiers who survive the bloody churn,
To a Britain not fit for heroes, will one day soon return.
With their grannies frozen to death, their families drowned in debt,
The farms sold off to Blackrock, and no jobs for them to get.

For the people that you love, and for the things that you own.
But in Sir Keir Starmer’s Britain, empire’s the only aim,
No matter what it costs in lives or the eternal shame.

When in reality, he, just like the rest of them, came to the group with his own experiences, thoughts, dreams and talents. While I am sure, because he has said so himself, he took on parts of each of them, the same is true for the other six. Some are more kind and aware of the needs of others because of Jungkook. Some practice a little harder, and push themselves to new levels because of his influence. Some are better singers because of his guidance. 
Jungkook is a talented, multi-faceted, generous and full grown adult who has earned all of his achievements through hard work and tenacity. Stop trying to take that away from him.

The Dem Party is coming for our gas appliances.

The SCAQMD is planning to ban natural gas water heaters and furnaces and force homeowners, rental property owners, and businesses to replace them with expensive electric powered versions when the electric grid is already insufficient.

Can our gas stoves be far behind?

The arrogant Democrat, elitist tyrants on the SCAQMD and in Sacramento care not one iota for the people they rule and are supposed to represent and serve. (I think it’s actually worse than they don’t care. They affirmatively hate our country and people. They want to wreck the country and make our lives worse.)

Forcing homeowners, rental property owners, and businesses large and small to replace their gas appliances will be economically devastating. In addition, when the electricity goes off, we won’t have heat or hot water.

See the attached flyer.

******************************
The next public hearing is May 1, 2025. In the meantime, if you want natural gas appliances email cob@aqmd.gov

The Dem Party’s arrogant assault on the working men and women of California as well as businesses large and small, presents a great opportunity for the Rep Party. They can champion tens of millions of homeowners, renters, and business owners.

The Reps should organize opposition to the SCAQMD rules. More broadly, the Reps should stand for the right and freedom of Californians to choose the type of appliances they think best. “We’re pro-choice on appliances.”

The Reps should introduce legislation to protect natural gas appliances from our right banning and regulations that make them more expensive. The legislation won’t pass or even get a vote, so the Reps should follow up with an initiative for the 2026 ballot.

The Reps should do the same for gas powered cars.

The old Republican Party was too afraid to fight for what is right even when it is politically popular. We’ll see if the CA Rep Party has learned from Donald Trump.

There were some isolated incidents in the past where groundwater was contaminated, but this was because the operators didn't follow standard procedures. Imagine trying to do anything non-standard with our over-zealous HSE here in the UK. No, it would all be done by the book, and risk no danger to groundwater.
