If a district court judge wants control over the entire executive branch…he should run for president.
We need to take Tesla Tiny houses for Gazans after we kick the fake Palestinians out of the country and set them up on the land alloted to them by the Balford Agreement and give them a cut of the profits from the natural gas and crude oil we will generate from Gaza. It's fair.

"Canada doesn’t mean anything to the American economy?

We will make sure to keep our steel and aluminum, our oil and gas, our potash, our nickel and uranium, our electricity, our water, our lumber. We will keep the $19 billion annually Canadians spend on travel to the United States, which includes cross-border shopping. More than 20 million Canadians travel to the United States each year. We can keep those people at home too. We can find new international trading partners who are not going to insult our national pride or threaten our sovereignty. We can hurt the Americans. We can redevelop Canadian manufacturing and compete with anyone on the world stage. 

We have to see Donald Trump is an opportunity, however. We should withdraw immediately from any trade agreements with the Americans. We don’t need them.

Yes, this will hurt it first, but we can also distance ourselves from the catastrophe that is coming south of the border.

Americans do understand that these tariffs are nothing but inflationary measures that are going to negatively impact Americans consumers, right?"

"Breaking:

Genocide case and report of Biafrans has been on ICCs table without any action or response

The genocide of Christians have been reported to European Union who told PM Simon Ekpa that the case is outside EU purview

BUT the same Europe through Finland is investigating Simon Ekpa based on a case brought to them by Nigeria. Is Nigeria not outside EU purview?(letter attached)

Where is the justice

Now;

Trump slaps sanctions on the ICC and targets 'anti-Christian bias' 

United States of Biafra is a Sovereign Christian Nation and the genocide by the Nigeria state  must stop

"New evidence reveals that in China, surgeons have actively participated in executions for organ harvesting. A study of 3,000 medical reports uncovered shocking cases where doctors performed surgeries on living prisoners, a grotesque violation of transplant ethics. Despite global silence, this abuse must be acknowledged and confronted. #OrganHarvesting

The CCP has long been accused of harvesting organs from prisoners of conscience on an industrial scale. A 2019 UK tribunal concluded that “forced organ harvesting has been committed for years throughout China on a significant scale” and identified Falun Gong practitioners as a primary source for these organs.

https://t.co/OVyL7si7vt

In China, New Evidence That Surgeons Became Executioners

Eight doctors at the Tongji Medical College hospital in Wuhan, China, traveled 40 miles on March 18, 1994, to procure a heart from a death-row prisoner. But rather than wait until the judicial authorities had executed the prisoner, the doctors carried out the execution themselves—by heart extraction.

In a large-scale review we conducted of nearly 3,000 Chinese-language clinical reports and published in the American Journal of Transplantation, we find surgeons acknowledging such actions again and again.

The Wuhan doctors write: “When the chest of the donor was opened, the chest wall incision was pale and bloodless, and the heart was purple and beating weakly. But the heartbeat became strong immediately after tracheal intubation and oxygenation. The donor heart was extracted with an incision from the 4th intercostal sternum into the chest. . . . This incision is a good choice for field operation where the sternum cannot be sawed open without power.”

By casually noting that the donor was connected to a ventilator (“tracheal intubation”) only at midsurgery, the physicians inadvertently reveal that the donor was alive when the operation began.

For a declaration of brain death to be legitimate, the organ donor must have lost the ability to breathe spontaneously and have already been intubated. This is a well-established medical principle associated with a basic rule of transplant ethics: Donors must be deceased before vital organs are removed.

Yet our research finds scores of reports—over a three-decade period, at 56 Chinese hospitals, involving more than 300 medical workers—in which brain death was described as having been declared before the donor was intubated. They were often intubated immediately before surgery. In the 1994 Wuhan case, intubation took place after the surgery began. In other cases, there was no intubation at all.

It has long been known that China harvests organs from death-row prisoners and prisoners of conscience as part of a large-scale, lucrative trade. To the extent that such religious minorities as Falun Gong and Uyghur Muslims have been targeted, a London-based independent tribunal described it as a crime against humanity and potentially a component of genocide. Yet until now there has been no systematic study of the role of doctors in carrying out the executions themselves.

To perform the study, we wrote code to download 124,770 Chinese-language medical papers. We wrote custom algorithms to search them for evidence of these abuses. We found 71 clinical reports making explicit admissions of surgeon killing, and we suspect these were a tiny portion of a large, hidden population. Thousands of papers have been published in China about heart and lung transplantation, but most say nothing about how the donor was handled.

Our findings end in 2015, but we think the abuse likely continues. Medical papers like those we studied were first unearthed by Chinese grass-roots investigators in late 2014, and it would have been simple to command journals to stop publishing the incriminating details after that. While China claims to have stopped using prisoners in 2015, our previous research raises doubts. In a 2019 paper in the journal BMC Medical Ethics, we used statistical forensics to show that the official voluntary-organ donation numbers were falsified, inflating the success of a modest voluntary organ-donation reform program used to buttress the reform narrative.

Global medical leaders have largely dismissed such concerns. The World Health Organization took advice from Chinese transplant surgeons in the establishment of its anti-organ-trafficking task force—and then installed them on the membership committee. In 2020, WHO officials joined long-time apologists for China’s transplant system, attacking our previous research showing falsified numbers.

The Chinese state’s use of medicine as a tool of repression is well known, as seen in the use of psychiatry to repress dissent, conduct forced abortions and more. Most recently, medicine has been implicated in the genocide of the Uyghurs. Experts with the British Medical Association noted in its journal, the BMJ, that “the Chinese government systematically deployed medical professionals, medical skills, and medical technologies in pursuit of these crimes.”

Yet the global transplant community has largely accepted China’s claims of reform and ignored evidence to the contrary. Comparisons to the medical atrocities of the Nazis haven’t galvanized a response, perhaps having lost all potency due to overuse. Western political leaders have likewise shown little interest in investigating the abuse.

We hope this will begin to change with these most recent revelations. It is now known that highly trained surgeons have for decades been killing prisoners with their scalpels on the operating table. This is a novel and extreme deviation from global norms. With the publication of these findings in the leading transplant journal, perhaps the issue will no longer be so easy to ignore."

"Ken Paxton: Soros Controls 70% of Texas Through Elected DAs

Ken Paxton warns that George Soros has funded district attorneys in major Texas cities, controlling 70% of the state’s population and hampering crime prosecution.

“George Soros has figured out how to destabilize America. He’s elected DAs in Democratic counties (Austin, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio), controlling 70% of Texas’ population. These Soros-funded DAs won’t prosecute crimes, creating an open invitation for cartels and foreign crime groups. Our legislature could fix this by giving the attorney general concurrent jurisdiction, but they haven’t.”

"""Midazolam and morphine are both respiratory suppressants... so we were prescribing medications which stop people breathing who are having trouble breathing...that guideline killed tens and tens of thousands of...elderly... and their deaths were put down as 'COVID' deaths.""

Andrew Bridgen (@ABridgen), a former Independent Member of U.K. Parliament, describes for Liz Gunn (@LizGunnNZ) how the ""NICE guidelines""—that is, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines that serve as a set of recommendations and standards for health and social care practice in the U.K.—called for COVID protocols that were killing the elderly. Bridgen specifically highlights the use of midazolam and morphine, two respiratory suppressants, that were used to kill elderly patients, particularly during the so-called ""first wave"" of COVID. 

""The Scottish COVID inquiry being held up there, the official one, [they're] talking about...the vaccine harms and midazolam, the use of Nice Guidelines 163, where a respiratory suppressant was prescribed,"" Bridgen says. ""Midazolam and morphine are both respiratory suppressants, [and] combined as a treatment they're even more so...[and they were] prescribed to vulnerable elderly who were thought to have COVID-19. So we were prescribing a medication which stops people breathing who are having trouble breathing.""

Bridgen goes on to say: 

""It's interesting...that NICE guideline NG 163 was an emergency authorization in, I think it was the third of April 2020 in response to COVID-19. It was superseded by NG 191, which is much more comprehensive. The element of midazolam was taken out in November '23, I believe. That was taken out of the new guidelines and modified. So they're admitting that was a mistake. 

""But what's really interesting is that although NICE guidelines are superseded by subsequent guidelines, every single NICE guideline is on the NHS website going back historically. So NG 163, NG 1 would be there, the first NICE guideline. There's only one that's been deleted off their system. There's no trace of it whatsoever, and that's NG 163...and...I asked the government why is this the only guideline that's ever been deleted off the website. You can't find any trace of it. It sounds to me as if they're feeling guilty. 

""[And] they should...because I think that that guideline killed tens and tens of thousands of vulnerable elderly who were moved out of hospital in the spring in early 2020 to make way for the first expected wave of ""COVID patients"" who never arrived. They were moved into nursing homes and care homes, many of them without the medication they'd been taking in hospital, but they were prescribed midazolam and morphine. They suffered respiratory failure, and their deaths were put down as COVID deaths."""

"As Part of Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi’s Diplomatic Tour: Meeting with UK House of Lords & House of Commons

As part of his ongoing diplomatic tour across Europe, Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi met today with members of the UK House of Lords and House of Commons. During the meeting, His Highness emphasized the necessity of maximum pressure on the Islamic Republic, maximum support for the Iranian people, the full designation of the IRGC as a terrorist organization, and an investigation into the regime’s infiltration in the UK. The Crown Prince stated that the era of appeasement is over, and that only a free and democratic Iran can ensure regional peace and stability.
🔹 This meeting is part of a broader diplomatic effort. His Highness had previously met with French Senate and National Assembly officials, urging an end to appeasement and concrete support for the Iranian people.
🔹 Upcoming Major Events: Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi is set to speak at the Munich Security Conference (Feb 14–16) and the Geneva Summit for Human Rights (Feb 18) as a keynote speaker.

In reality, speed and consistency lead to victory, contrary to the tale of The Hare and the Tortoise. However, in the new family film Turbo, we witness Hollywood's growing affection for the slow and steady underdog. This trend began with Pixar's Cars and Cars 2, where a fiery racer learns to slow down and value what truly matters. This theme continued with Disney's Planes, which tells a similar story featuring a charmingly slow crop-duster that dreams of competing against ""race planes.""

Now, we have a unique narrative centered on a snail—yes, a snail—who aims to race cars in the Indianapolis 500. Turbo's extraordinary ability comes from an accidental encounter with turbocharged nitrous oxide during a drag race, transforming him into a speedy contender."

Was this allocated by Congress as an expenditure? NO

A secret met report stated there ten times more likely to be corrupt then any other demographic in the police 

Former police constable Muhammed Mustafa Darr was also sentenced over accessing police records, including into a fraud investigation into himself, at Southwark Crown Court on Monday.
The 39-year-old had pleaded guilty to three charges of misconduct in public office, and was sentenced to 40 months’ imprisonment, according to the police watchdog.
On multiple occasions he also passed on confidential information in the police records to friends and people he knew who asked him to, the IOPC added.
In June 2020, Darr stole a laptop and bag from a member of the public’s unlocked vehicle after he arrested a man for a driving offence.
In a separate incident, Darr admitted to using the bank details of two deceased people whose addresses he attended following reports of their deaths."

"Why have we constructed a society where it's seemingly necessary for both parents to be back at work less than a year after the birth of their child, and their child to be in fulltime childcare? 

For whose benefit has society been created in this way? 

Because I'd suggest it isn't for the benefit of most children, or for most  parents. 

It is, however,  for the benefit of the State, as it brings in lots of extra tax for the Treasury, and allows the State to get its paws on our children at a much younger age.

If we created a society like this, surely we can uncreate it, and return to the situation a generation or two ago, when a single wage was enough to support a family, and most children were raised by a full time parent until starting primary school?"

Parasite Dolls is what happens when someone takes Ghost in the Shell and Blade Runner, cranks up the nihilism, and then forgets to add any actual depth.

"Real time Paramedic info: 

Just worked another exhausting shift that's opened my eyes even further. Running back-to-back calls to vaccinated patients with 'COVID' and pneumonia. The pattern is undeniable.
Just transported another nursing home patient, the nurse told me 'flu AND covid.' I asked if their residents were all vaccinated. (Which I knew they were already) The look on her face said everything. She couldn't even respond.
These aren't isolated cases. Every shift, I'm watching vaccinated people get sicker and sicker. Multiple infections, repeated hospitalizations. The same type of patients over and over.

The narrative was that these shots would prevent serious illness. Instead, I'm watching the opposite unfold in real time. As a frontline healthcare worker, I wont stay silent.
This is why I refused to administer these shots. This is why I lost my last job. But I sleep well knowing I stood up for what's right. Well, I sleep well when the tones aren’t going off. 

To my fellow healthcare workers: How long will you pretend this isn't happening? How many more patients need to suffer before you speak up?

Truth is worth losing a job over. I'll never regret choosing conscience over compliance.

"Turbo (2013)

I genuinely enjoyed this film. While it’s clear that it draws heavily from Pixar's Cars franchise in both concept and execution, that’s really the only drawback. The story of a small garden snail achieving great things is quite inspiring. Yes, the race track resembles those from the first and third Cars films, but it still manages to have its own distinct style. I appreciated the visuals, especially the plot twist where Turbo's racing hero turns against him in an effort to defeat him, even attempting to eliminate him for winning. I found it delightful when Tito discovers Turbo and introduces him to his friends, each with their own racing snails. It was also amusing how Turbo inadvertently caused chaos for his snail colony, and I found it intriguing that the snails seemed indifferent to the loss of one of their own, reminiscent of the colony in Antz. While I wouldn’t call this film a masterpiece, it certainly isn’t as bad as many people claim."

"Palestinian hostage Mohammad Barash was released today after 22 years

 Prior to his capture, in April 2002, occupation forces attempted to assassinate him, striking him with a shell near the Grand Park Hotel in Ramallah. 

The attack resulted in the amputation of his left leg, complete blindness in his right eye, corneal damage in his left eye, and shrapnel wound

He once said: 

“Don't tell my mother that I have gone blind; she sees me, but I do not see her. I smile and pretend at the visitation window when she wants to show me pictures of my siblings, my friends, and our neighbors. She doesn't know that I have lost my sight, that illness took over my eyes until darkness consumed my entire body. Don't tell her that I have been waiting for a corneal transplant surgery for years, but the prison administration keeps stalling."""

"I’ve been feeling very flat recently. Not tired or anxiety or depression that normally gets me down but just flat. Feeling meh. A sense of nothing if that makes sense. Despite everything going on at full throttle to help dogs I’m sort of on autopilot and feeling empty.

I think it’s 2 things…

💜 Alba obviously. Like so many I really fell In love with her. I just miss really. Strange as I only knew her 2 weeks and I have dozens of other dogs to worry about and fix but sometimes dogs / people just hit different I guess. I’m doing lots in her honor and pushing myself hard to do stuff in her name but I’d love a little sunrise with her. 

👀 The second one is harder to explain. I just feel everybody is looking for me. No matter what I do or where I go people want my time. Happy doggo. Tina’s hospital. Media. Publishing a book. People in cafes. Messages online. Emails. Dogs to be saved. Money needed. Favors. I can’t and won’t complain about that because I know I’m super privileged and I don’t want to sound like a a spoilt moaning brat. I know all this stuff is needed to help more dogs at scale and I’m more committed than ever. Sometimes I’d just love to be back helping 20 dogs on my moped when not one person knew me. 

I’ve posted a lot less here the last 2 weeks also. I’ve lots of great wins and happy things to post but when it comes to it I just can’t be bothered. What’s there to be so happy about I think when I go to post it. Even this post I deleted a couple of times. I don’t want to ever be miserable on here. I just wanted to be honest. 

Lots of great things happening and big progress but I guess I just feel a bit sad still about Alba. Big day with the dogs tomorrow will fix it. They are the best tonic. 

Have a lovely weekend 

Niall 💜"

"The photograph is captioned: ‘""Bruce"", a well-known messenger dog who is always working under shell fire in the line.'

Bruce is with his British handler on the Western Front in France during WW1.  This collie dog worked as a messenger in the front line under constant shell fire.  A scrolled up message can be seen attached to the dog’s collar.

Dogs were also used in the trenches to kill rats and mice, thereby protecting food supplies.  In addition to carrying out messenger duties and various other tasks, a regimental mascot also helped to maintain the troops’ morale.

Most of the armies involved in 'the Great War' had specially trained dogs in many of their regiments. These dogs performed a wide range of important tasks, including carrying messages, sentry duty, acting as decoys, ambulance duties, and killing vermin.

Keeping a pet also helped to raise the morale of the soldiers by adding an element of domestic home life to the trench.

✍️Peter Barnes 
I searched around online for any information if Bruce survived to live out his life in peace, but I couldn’t find anything, except a book titled ‘Bruce’, which is about a collie who was a courier dog during WW1, who saved a lot of soldiers.  I'm not sure if it is the same dog though.  . 

Lest We Forget.

Photograph came from the National Library of Scotland."

Joe Biden was a puppet in charge of nothing. The corporate media and Democrat Party engaged in a monstrous coverup to conceal this now indisputable truth.

Our government was instead run by unelected bureaucrats who ruthlessly weaponized state power against their political enemies, engineered mass illegal voting in our elections, installed a draconian censorship regime, instituted a colossal system of state-sponsored racial discrimination, orchestrated a vast border invasion to try to permanently alter the balance of power, trafficked half a million children across the border, allowed criminals to freely terrorize our citizens, and raided the treasury to fund a political army of marxist radicals in a bid for permanent control over US institutions.

President Trump saved America and democracy itself."

"[Forbes] 250210 BTS’s Jin Breaks His Tie With BP With A New Top 10 Bestseller
Jin is back inside the top 10 on not one, but two different Billboard charts this week. His latest single “Close to You” succeeds almost exclusively thanks to an early and impressive sales count, one which helps him break out of a tie with another one of South Korea's greatest musical exports.
“Close to You” launches at No. 9 on the Digital Song Sales chart this week. The tune marks Jin’s sixth solo appearance inside the highest tier on Billboard's ranking of the bestselling tracks throughout the country.
With a sixth top 10 to his credit, Jin passes Blackpink on the list of the most successful South Korean artists of all time on the Digital Song Sales chart--at least when looking specifically at those musicians that have accrued the most top 10s. Before “Close To You” arrived, he was matched with the girl group with five top 10s apiece, but now he's passed them.

$MMTLP is the biggest shell game sham in history—one that has nothing to do with NextBridge, Torchlight, or Meta Materials. Instead, it’s an intricate web of financial crime operating at the highest levels, involving regulatory bodies, legal entities, and non-functioning dilutive companies exchanges and market makers.

Hey Everyone!

In case you didn't know, @BitunixOfficial is already a giant in the crypto exchange space... It has once again proven its commitment to innovation by listing three intriguing tokens: XYO ( $XYO), GoPlus Security ( $GPS), and MyShell ( $SHELL). 

These listings diversifies #Bitunix’s trading options and also highlight the exchange’s focus on supporting projects that push the boundaries of blockchain technology. 

So, it does not really matter whether you’re a seasoned trader or a curious newcomer, these tokens offer a glimpse into the future of decentralized data, on-chain security, and AI-driven ecosystems. 

Let’s break down what makes each of these tokens unique and why their inclusion on Bitunix is a big deal in this Thread 🧵

"Something to know about Old Salty. 

I really don’t have any friends other than folks on here. A man I thought was my best friend, seems to have shut me out of his life. But, I’m okay with it!

Back in the day, I got out of the USMC. Went to a dance one night. Ran into a lot of high school friends. I was immediately cussed out, spit at and called names. All because I served in the USMC and participated in things they didn’t approve of. 

Spent many years, fighting my feelings and other things that happened in my childhood. Went through some real bad anger issues. 

I’ve never let people get that close to me again, except my wife! I got into coaching kids, something I never got to experience as a kid, it gave me a purpose to live. 

I played sports but never really had a coach. At 14 we won a City Championship in baseball. I was the coach and the pitcher on the team. No pitching rules, applied back then. I pitched every game except two. 

Now, that I’m older, people that I thought were friends have pretty much abandoned me again. I suspect, it’s all because I can’t afford to pay for their drinks, host Christmas parties or put up with their bullshit!

What you read, see, hear about me is who I am! I never cower down to anyone. It’s just not in my DNA! 

Kinda, sorta like my Mom did when she had me at 15 years old and was kicked out by her parents. She was a very strong Lady! 

Much like Old Salty. A kind heart, filled with love…until it was/is time to not be!"

"💎 The cryture of the day is Petchill! 💎

Having completely retreated into their flowery shell, these crytures enjoy a much more thorough camouflage than their younger forms. Most hunting crytures will completely overlook a Petchill in hiding, and those that don't are usually deterred by a blast of frost or irritating pollen. 

Cunning ones will use this camouflage offensively, leading a group of Buddlies to ambush other crytures and feast on their essence. With their low needs for essence, a Petchill that employs this tactic can achieve their final metamorphosis quite quickly.

Ego is the biggest obstacle to personal growth. Until we break free from its shell, learning and improving remain impossible. True success lies in humility because those who bow down are the ones who rise. Real strength comes from accepting mistakes and learning from others.
"I'm going to start this rant with a few major disclaimers, being a Nurse and having done this for over 20 yrs. Please bear with me.

My 24 yr old son went to the Dr the other day and had some labs done. Before the labs were even drawn, his Dr told him he was pre-diabetic. Oh, really? Based on what? When you haven't even drawn any blood, to verify it?

They also told him he has hypertension. He's 24 yrs old, for God's sake! His BP was 138/86. That one reading is NOT high blood pressure! It's typically due to stress, being at the Dr, we call it ""white coat syndrome"". Wait 10 minutes and take it again. This is SOP. But did they do that? NO.

So, today, he got his lab work back. His glucose (non-fasting) was 102. He's freaking out. Ok, child. What was your A1C? They didn't test it... BS! Until they do an A1C and it's over 6.5, you are NOT diabetic. Why didn't they do an A1C? They told him they won't do that until his Blood glucose level is over 100 for several months. Again, I do this for a living. That's total BS. His non-fasting blood glucose would've had to been in the range of over 150+, for us to even consider him either pre diabetic or diabetic. But, without an A1C, we couldn't confirm it, with any accuracy, at all. 

Then, they tell him he's got hypothyroidism, because his range was high. Ok. What was the result? They didn't say. 

I want to see ALL of the results, in writing. And they say he has hyperlipidemia... Again, what were the levels? His answer was, I don't know. They just said over 100. 99 is the baseline. 

FFS! Show me some real numbers and then I'll accept your diagnoses. Until then, I think you're taking advantage of my child's naivete and trying to put him on meds he doesn't need. 

I'm so pissed off, right now! This is NOT how we do medicine! 😡🤬😡"

"All my life, I’ve heard the phrase:

 “Business is business.”

But over time, I’ve come to realize that business is really about people.

Before entering the university,

I thought studying Accounting in school was my ticket to success.

 I learned about profit, loss, marketing plans, and problem-solving, all the traditional fundamentals.

But something was missing.

It wasn’t until I learned from this web3 space

I discovered the secret ingredient my school never taught me,  the power of people.

Think about it,

Who are you marketing to?

Who are you solving problems for?

Who will help you achieve your goals?

Who will refer you to others?

The answer to all of these is people.

At every level of business, human connections are at the center of everything. 

How you interact with people whether it’s clients, projects, founders, Devs, customers, teammates, or partners can make or break your success.

If you're a brand or you're building a business, 

Here’s the hard truth:

Marketing fails when you don’t understand your audience.

Branding falls flat when it doesn’t connect emotionally.

Partnerships crumble without trust.

Teams underperform without genuine leadership.

When you focus on truly listening to and understanding people, you build trust.

 You make them feel heard. And that’s what makes people want to do business/work with you.

If you’re ready to prioritize people and transform the way you do business, let’s connect 👇

"I’d be quite happy paying taxes if it was for the benefit of the UK & being spent on the UK.

The problem being that the UK has been underfunded over many many years & is now a shell of its former self.

The blame goes to consecutive governments that have allowed this to happen & are just giving our money away to whoever puts their hands out.

Government could easily put the tax threshold up to £20k to ease people’s suffering but they choose not to as they just want us to struggle.

We should not be having to put up with this & they need to be made accountable."

Without health, you have nothing. Preventative medicine should be the foundation of healthcare. It’s time to shift from reactive ‘sick care’ to proactive WELLNESS, where we prevent illness before it starts. True healthcare empowers, educates, heals, and sustains.

🐱To the seniors at Nadao who have taken care of Sky, thank you for everything. Thank you, P’Yong, for always supporting Sky. Thank you so much. Thank you for making it possible for us to meet in this world. I don’t even know how to repay this, but we promise that we will do our best and walk together as far as we can. No matter if one day we have to part ways, our feelings will never change. We have made a promise.

🐱I also want to thank Sky. Thank you so much. Today, let me give you a hug, man, seriously. You’re amazing, truly amazing. I just want to say that you’re incredible. I told you that you could do it, see? You’re so talented. If anyone says Sky can’t do it, I’ll argue against them with everything I have. If anyone says Sky isn’t good at dancing, well, he has his own unique dance style that no one else in the world has. He’s incredible, and I’m so proud of my friend. Thank you, Sky, for choosing to walk this path together with us. Thank you, everyone, truly.

🐶Thank you for everything. I want to thank those that started Nani’s journey in the industry. Thank you P’Kong, for introducing Nani to the entertainment world. Thank you P’Tha, for deciding to cast Nani in F4. Thank you P’O, and everyone at Parbdee. Thank you to F4, Bright, Win, Dew, and everyone in his life and those he had a chance to work with. Thank you for shaping Nani into who he is today and for helping him grow into a better version of himself. Right now, I don’t want to say “the best,” but he is the best for me right now.

🐶But I also believe that in the future, Nani will go even further. Maybe next time, he’ll have his own solo concert and showcase his full potential. I just want to say that I believe in you, and I know you can do it. We’ve talked about this before. There were people who doubted you, but today, you proved them all wrong. 4,000+ people here can be your witnesses, as well as P’Tha and all the staff member. I just want to cheer you up and remind you to keep believing in yourself, even though I don’t have confidence in myself.

"20 DEC - BP

Be an empty vessel - innocence - without stories - the ego blocks you from being a bansuri

After the session, I was reading the 'For You' articles. 

In one of them, the questioner argues that how can one be passionate if they have a disregard for the world. 

To which Acharya Ji says:

""Passion can come only with disregard. It is because if passion starts regarding ‘this and that’, then ‘this and that’ will dominate the passion.""

And I thought that I understood the word ""passion"" but the 1st sentence was such a wtf moment for me. How ignorant I am, and how Innocent is He to take the word without it's stories. Thank you for the live demonstration 🙏

I can't even read straight. I can't even hear!

Another standout was when the questioner asked Him why he chose this life after IIT and IIM, to which he replied:

""IIT and IIM should be things that empower you, not degrees or facts that become millstones around your neck. Coming from an IIT, one should be more free, not less. Coming from an IIM, one should be more fearless, not less. But the opposite happens.""

This is what happens in the arts as well. When I was learning Jazz, I was worried that if I practice too many scales and learn theory I will be chained to these patterns, whereas knowing more should  free you to go play, but the opposite happens. 

Just another story that I told myself to not practice.

Anyways, enjoy the article:

The stone could easily break the egg, but he doesn't. The stone lets the egg sit atop of him to feel mightier and protects the fragile shell the egg has put up to keep the soft inside from being shown to the world.
"The land #snail #Helix #lucorum (#Helicidae, #Stylommatophora) is a #species with a noticeably large shell that is originally distributed in Asia Minor and the Black Sea region. H. lucorum impresses with its particularly decorative #striped snail #shell, whereby the basic color can have different shades depending on environmental conditions or due to genetic variability. The snail species, also known as #Escargot Turk due to its natural distribution in #Turkey, is one of three species of the Helix genus that humans eat as a #delicacy. The other two species are Helix #aspersum and Helix #pomatia.

H. lucorum lives in bushes, open forest landscapes and also on cultivated land. The snail species does not remain dormant during the winter in its natural range, but instead spends the hot summer months in dry torpor while buried in the ground. The snail can also be found outside its natural range in regions to which it has been introduced by humans, such as in France and even a limited area in Germany. In such cases one speaks of #neozoa. Unlike H. pomatia and H. aspersum, H. lucorum is a species that is not usually bred as #humanfood, but is collected from the field for these purposes.

The author I. Ekin (2023) dealt with the #reproductiveprocesses of the species H. lucorum and Eobania vermiculata and studied them in the field for several years. But here I will only summarize H.ucorum information. According to the researcher, the snail begins to #reproduce at the age of 3-4 years, in a period from October to December. Observations took place in Diyarbakır, SE Turkey. The snails laid 82 ± 12 #eggs that were 5 mm in diameter. The young offspring hatched after 30 ± 4 days. The author assumes that #breedinghabits might vary depending on localities and their climatic conditions.

"In a judgment entered on 1st March 2017, the Federal High Court Abuja ruled that

which can be verified from: https://t.co/UwJ5edDlBL
unlawful-group-court/amp/. This landmark ruling (made by the court before it turned
unjust) emanated in a criminal proceedings that required “proof beyond reasonable
doubt” and in which the federal government and my humble self presented our
respective cases. Alas! Instead of the federal government to go on appeal as the
law mandated (if they are dissatisfied with the judgment), the former Attorney-
General (Abubakar Malami) went behind closed doors with a letter signed by late
Abba Kyari and got IPOB proscribed/tagged a terrorist group in an ex parte
proceedings conducted without notice to me or to the IPOB. This abominable
incident was the earliest sign yet that the government and its judiciary have struck
an unholy and fraudulent alliance to deny me my rights and thereby imperil the lives
and liberty of millions who identity with IPOB.

"The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water (2015) 

is a live-action/animated hybrid film based on SpongeBob SquarePants. It’s the second SpongeBob movie,

When the secret formula for Krabby Patties is stolen by the pirate Burger-Beard (played by Antonio Banderas), Bikini Bottom falls into chaos. To get it back, SpongeBob and his friends—Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Sandy, and even Plankton—must venture to the surface. They use a magic book to transform into superhero versions of themselves and battle Burger-Beard in a wild action-packed climax."

The story follows SpongeBob and his friends as they try to retrieve the Krabby Patty secret formula, which has been stolen by a pirate named Burger-Beard (played by Antonio Banderas). Without the formula, Bikini Bottom falls into chaos, resembling a post-apocalyptic wasteland. To recover it, SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and Sandy must travel to the surface, where they gain superhero-like powers to battle Burger-Beard."
"The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water (2015)

"*** SHEPHERD of STARS ***
#shepherdofstars

Foreword

Welcome to a journey that challenges the conventions of storytelling and invites you to an exploration of the soul. Written by Mattia Ruggeri with editing by Stefano Turicchia, “Shepherd of Stars” is not a book to be read; it’s an experience to be lived, in some ways reminiscent of the fragmented structure and inner journey found in works like Dante Alighieri’s “Divine Comedy,” where the journey through Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise is also a descent and ascent into the human soul.

At the outset, you will find a world that welcomes you with harmony, where characters and settings unfold gradually, allowing you to settle into a plot that seems to follow a familiar path, similar to the initial calm found in the pages of Hermann Hesse’s “Siddhartha,” where the spiritual quest begins with the simplicity and curiosity of the protagonist.

But be warned, for this is only the beginning of a journey that will transform into a race towards infinity. As you progress through the chapters, you’ll notice that the narrative time accelerates, the boundaries between characters blur, and symbols multiply without explanation, evoking the complexity and flow of time in James Joyce’s “Ulysses,” where each page challenges linear understanding. This is not a mistake or a lack of structure; it’s a deliberate choice.
It’s an invitation to leave behind traditional storytelling and dive into the depths of your personal comprehension, like a modern “Book of Disquiet” by Fernando Pessoa, where the narrative is more an inner reflection than a story told.

This book is designed to free you from the servitude to a predetermined story, pushing you to become the master of your own reading. Each page you turn is a step towards disorientation, towards the loss of narrative control, with the aim of awakening within you the power to find meaning without external guidance, mirroring the approach of allegory and symbolism in Ezra Pound’s “Pisan Cantos,” where each verse is an enigma to decipher.

Do not expect a conventional ending; “Shepherd of Stars” will abruptly interrupt, leaving you with the incompleteness of life itself, akin to the act in Joyce’s “Finnegans Wake,” where the narrative cycle closes and reopens, suggesting an endless continuity. This interruption is not an end but a beginning. It’s the moment when you must lift your gaze from the text and turn it towards yourself, towards your questions and answers, just as happens in the mystical texts of Rumi or St. John of the Cross, where reading is an experience of spiritual elevation.

Prepare yourselves, then, not to be mere readers, but explorers of a new dimension of storytelling, where the true journey is within you, and where the book serves as a mirror of your soul. In this sense, “Shepherd of Stars” stands as a contemporary ode to self-discovery and transformation, a theme that resonates through the centuries, from Plato’s “Symposium” to Augustine’s “Confessions,” inviting you to a dialogue with your deepest essence.

This introduction not only aims to prepare the reader for the experience of the book but also to situate it within a literary tradition, highlighting how “Shepherd of Stars” dialogues with the past while maintaining its own experimental uniqueness.
Safe travels towards the stars of your being.

While today’s announcement is a momentary win, Newsom’s Air Resources Board has 120 days to address the issue and resubmit.

Gas corporations are supposed to pay a ‘royalty’ for the right to extract and sell public resources – resources like liquified natural gas. But the Australian Government is failing to collect many royalties, effectively giving away over half gas exported from Australia – for free.

"Dear @JustinTrudeau,  

Listen up, Justin—you’ve got some bloody nerve! You and your sniveling Liberal clowns are still squatting in Ottawa, clinging to that PM’s chair like a hemorrhoid we’re too disgusted to scrape off.
I’m sick to my guts watching you strut around, throwing our money, integrity and reputation out the window like glitter at some pride parade nobody asked for. I'm not the only one! 
Why the hell are you still pretending to be Canada’s Prime Minister, huh? A real PM needs a backbone, some guts, a scrap of courage—not ten years of your spineless, slimy dribble leaking out of Ottawa. A whole damn decade of this revolting crap—what’s your excuse, you gutless leech? 
 
Your “mandate”? What a nauseating farce—gone faster than your stupid sock obsession, but you’re still here, you shameless coward, proroguing Parliament like it’s some chore you’re too high and mighty to deal with. Dodging that confidence vote? That’s peak spinelessness—makes me want to puke! Your shaky little gang’s about to topple in a storm whipped up by Chrystia’s hurricane of a backside, but you’d rather lock the cottage door and hide than face us. 
 
And your spending—God, it’s obscene! You dumped $3.9 billion on SNC-Lavalin’s Alto rail scam on February 19th, and now there’s talk of your parting shot hitting $40 billion, their dirty hands all over it, locked in while Parliament’s choked—stinks of your cronyism and probably just bullshit gone wild.
Then $1.3 billion for border junk on February 3rd—every cent makes me gag, you only coughed up because Trump scared you shitless, not because Canadians demanded it for years while you smeared us as “ists” and “phobes” for daring to ask you to stop our porous border from infiltration. 
Fraser Institute’s got you dead to rights: $61.9 billion deficit last year, nine years of stinking red ink, highest per-person spending ever.
 
Oversight? Give me a break—Parliament’s shut down while you, you reckless prick, play Monopoly with our wrecked future.
  
SNC-Lavalin—sorry, AtkinsRéalis—Christ, what a disgusting mess! They copped to fraud in 2019—$48 million in Libyan bribes, $130 million stolen—$280 million fine, three years probation, and no court had the balls to ban them from contracts under YOUR slimy watch. You got nailed for twisting Jody Wilson-Raybould’s arm to save their asses—lost two ministers, but kept your buddies close. 
Bet that’s your next gig, huh? A cushy payoff for meddling in SNC Lavalin's prosecution. Now they’re back, sucking up that $3.9 billion rail job like the corruption’s just a fart we’ll forget. Between 2019 and 2020, 142 contracts, $25 million—your Liberals didn’t blink, you spineless worm. Courage? Hah! You wouldn’t know it if it bit you—handing out goodies to those vultures while we choke on the rot. Ask our G7 pals about that ethical LNG they begged for—where’d “no” get you there, huh?  

Then there’s the CBSA, puking their guts out in the Toronto Sun on February 12th—your pathetic policies let “endless streams” of gangs and cartels stomp all over us. 
Officers are screwed—forced to cut loose every “refugee” scammer, even the psychos, because of your suffocating rules. 
By September 2025, they won’t even be legally able to lock up the trash—Bin Laden’s cousin could stroll out grinning. Mexican cartels, Asian mobs—they’re laughing at your pitiful $1.3 billion “border plan,” while CBSA’s screaming for the army and you mumble “fentanyl czar” like it’s not a sick joke. Where’s the guts to stop it, Justin? Certainly not in Ottawa—which is just a black hole of cowardly filth since you marked your foul stench all over the PMO rug.  

And now, you’re ramming that unelected, smug bastard Mark Carney down our throats as your next act—another raving nutjob too unhinged to win a vote. Canadians won’t take two crazed freaky madmen in a row, you delusional creep—we’re still scrubbing your stench off! Carney’s your anointed nobody because no one with a pulse would touch your toxic shitshow—unelected, despised, and as spineless as you, he’s the perfect sequel to your ten-year trainwreck. So why keep up this disgusting farce? 
Or is it because you've been abiding by Carney's direction for so long that you are incapable of maneuvering on your own, and are so dazed and confused by the Davos master plan, you have no choice but to lay a path for Carney to finish what you failed at.
You have no mandate, no oversight, no balls—just reckless spending and a border wide open for chaos. 

You and your Liberals are a national embarrassment, prancing around while Canada gags on your slime. Grab your socks, your selfies, your sanctimonious crap, and get the hell out, you miserable fraud, before SNC-Lavalin builds us a cartel freeway with our last loonie!

You know how much notice I got before I was deemed “non-essential”? Precisely zero. Indeed, I was on my way to a shift on March 15th, 2020 when Governor Newsom declared bars and restaurants to be closed statewide. 

The day prior to that I’d had my last shift at my other job (tutoring)—except I didn’t know that at the time. 

I figured it out real quick, though. I never saw either of those jobs again because of how apparently “non-essential” I was. 

So forgive me if I don’t have many tears to spare over the casualties of the new administration cutting government bloat.

"Why doesn’t BC and Canada put a stop to these regressive woke climate policies and actually open the door to new investment in oil & gas, LNG, mining, and forestry—industries that built this province and country?

Just a few weeks ago, I was in Prince George at the BC Natural Resources Forum, then up in Northern Cariboo on a transportation tour, talking to companies and people who have invested heavily in these industries. They told me firsthand that the routes they rely on aren’t even adequate to run an efficient business, let alone scale up while staying competitive.

More recently, I drove from the Lower Mainland to Kelowna through Peachland, Osoyoos, Grand Forks, Castlegar, Creston, and all the way up to Kootenay Bay. I made stops along the way and spoke with people in these communities. What I heard was the same story everywhere—these industries have been depleted and forgotten, and it’s tearing apart the fabric of their towns.

Companies that would typically have a five-year growth plan are now working on five-year exit plans. They aren’t just shutting down and walking away—they’re trying to help their workers transition to other industries because they truly care about them. These businesses don’t treat their employees like numbers the way some massive corporations do, especially the ones locked into rigid union structures. It’s a completely different way of life, and it’s being wiped out.

BC was built on investment in the north, and that’s been completely abandoned. We’re never going to bridge the wealth gap or drive real economic development without reopening these industries. Oil, gas, LNG, mining, and forestry made this province what it is, and yet government policies have shut the door on everything that worked. Instead, they’re too busy pushing a woke agenda that does nothing to support the people who actually keep this economy running.

China counterattacked Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods with their own levies. They've imposed up to 15% tariffs on US coal, natural gas, oil, and certain vehicles, subtly countering Trump's hefty 10% duty on Chinese imports. This move affects around £16 billion of US goods, a fraction compared to the £360 billion from China.

China didn't stop at tariffs; they're scrutinizing Google for monopolistic practices and targeting US brands with sanctions. Trump's stance? Unperturbed, suggesting negotiations might ease tensions. This economic sparring highlights the complexities of international trade politics."

   China officially imposes 10–15% tariffs on U.S. oil, agricultural equipment, coal, and LNG. https://t.co/oSylwZEUCN"
"Before everyone loses their shit over China's tariffs on the USA.
HERE ARE SOME FACTS
China imports very little oil from the USA. It is in 10th place.
China imports 6% of its LNG from the USA. 4 million tons versus USA total export globally of 87 million tons in 2024."
"It's ridiculous to believe that China has the guts to impose 10-15% tariffs on US oil, agricultural equipment, coal, and LNG!

This is the only reason I wanted the US to suspend TikTok operations in the US. China has to understand that no matter how big or developed they are, the US still owns the market of any kind.

Anyway, I can't wait to see Trump's reaction to this. I think we'll soon have a tariff war all over the world."
"According to international media reports, Beijing immediately imposed a 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas following Trump's announcement of a 10% tariff on Chinese imports. 
On the other hand, U.S. President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, during a phone call, agreed to delay the tariffs imposed on each other for one month."
China will add 10-15% tariffs on U.S. coal and LNG. This is because of new U.S. tariffs, making trade between China and the U.S. more tense. https://t.co/ZXrDDLlyxZ

"Good morning, everyone! Umagang kay ganda sa inyong lahat!!

I just want to share how crazy it is that times right now are different, especially in this fast-growing world of social media where anything can be perceived, any issue can arise, any theories can be made, and just about anything can happen, whether it is good or bad.

I’ve been silent lately, but it’s because, in silence, you get to see and hear more. You learn a lot when you stay still. One thing I have also learned is that amidst the noise, in contrast to silence, He is what makes my world calm and at peace. As long as He is there, I will always carry my faith and my strength toward Him.

Today, I wake up feeling grateful because I know every day is an opportunity to surrender myself to Him. He is what brings me peace.

I hope and pray that everyone who reads this will always have love and peace in their hearts. I also pray for those who hold onto spite, that it may be washed away so they can find peace and goodness within.

The world needs love. People need love. I hope we are all filled with love so we can share it with others.

Happy Tuesday, everyone! Nothing but love from me. 🤍

See you later at our contract signing! 😌🥰

"🇨🇳 China has swiftly responded to the recent tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump by initiating an antitrust investigation into Google and levying a 10% tariff on 🇺🇲 American coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG). This move escalates the ongoing trade tensions between the two economic giants, highlighting how trade disputes can quickly affect international business practices and market access 🪃. The investigation into Google suggests concerns over market competition, while the tariffs on coal and LNG are likely aimed at impacting specific sectors of the U.S. economy in retaliation. This development could have broader implications for global trade dynamics, energy markets, and technology sector regulations.

Some volatility will happen to stay safe and trade accordingly. 💯"
The U.S is not subsidizing Canada &amp; Trump knows that. The U.S. is dependent on our crude oil, natural gas, electricity, potash, uranium &amp; lumber. That is why Trump wants Canada to become the 51st state. He wants our natural resources.

"I woke up crying this morning…

Sometimes I get scared that my dad will one day get old, and not be as agile as he used to be.

That man was our hero, everly reliable, remember those days at nights when it’ll be raining heavily, man would wake up to gather water for the house, while we sleep. 

He had a bike at one point, and he’ll proudly take us to school on it, no matter the weather, this continued until he eventually got a car…

He accompanied me and my siblings to all our examinations centres, including WAEC, and jamb, rich kids will be coming with different types of big cars, my dad will show up with his Toyota carina 2. And oh how proud I’ll be to know he’s out there waiting for me to come out of the exams hall. Thankfully, he has a better car today and he’s in a better place. 

Man was strong, he still is, but for how long?? We will all go to farm together but he’ll be the last one to come home, sometimes he’ll ask me to stay with him while others go home to prepare food, and I’ll be grumbling. Stupid me! 

Man was our electrician, our doctor, our custodian, our teacher, our religious leader, our first point of contact when anything goes wrong. Literally our everything. 

He was harsh on us but for good reasons. He carried family matter on his head, but never shied away from helping others as well, man is always there for everybody. 

He is not perfect but I could never ask for a better father, till today he runs a lot of things for me, including building projects and all…

I can only beg God to give him long life, and give me the strength to continue taking care of that man whenever he needs me. 

May God bless all the good men out there…"

"Eleven years ago millions of people in Ukraine had bravely stood up against a corrupt authoritarian regime during Revolution of Dignity. They took to the streets across the entire country, demanding that the regime continue moving towards Europe, towards genuine democratic values. They peacefully demonstrated just for a chance to build a country where rights of each person are protected, government accountable, courts independent, and police do not beat peaceful student demonstrators.

On the morning of February 20, 2014, our Euromaidan SOS hotlines started to be ringing all the time. People reported that peaceful demonstrators were being shot on the Maidan. 

Our volunteers went to morgues, churches, and hospitals to document information about the killed and wounded. They gave us photos of the bodies of the dead, their documents, and descriptions of personal belongings. We were in a hurry because we didn’t know how much time we had left to identify everyone killed by the Yanukovych regime. 

Around this time, my husband called me. He said that he was on the Maidan, that he loved me, and said goodbye. I had never been so scared in my life.

I only recently realized why I constantly burst into tears during my speeches. A few days after the shootings on the Maidan, we were preparing the first mobile group for Crimea. And then I went headlong into kidnapping, torture, sexual violence, and murder of civilians in the occupied territories. I have never cried over those February days in these 11 years. There was simply no time.

May the memory of all those who did not return be cherished. Strength to their families."

If Trump wants to see elections in Ukraine, all he has to do is use the power he keeps talking about to get the Russian invaders off Ukrainian soil. Then martial law in Ukraine ends, and elections will follow.
No, POTUS. #Zelensky is not a dictator. He is a resistant. He is the soul of his people (and of Europe). And he has, in #Ukraine, the popularity that Winston Churchill had, in 1944, in the UK.

"Mark Carney and the Liberals spent years blocking pipelines, killing jobs, and driving away investment. With Trump tariffs looming, Canada needs a West-East pipeline, but Carney is playing both sides.

In BC, he talks about using emergency powers to force provinces to accept big projects. In Quebec, he says he’d never do that. So which is it? Carney isn’t about building pipelines—he’s about more Liberal control and gaslighting Canadians.

Only Common Sense Conservatives will actually get pipelines built, unleash Canadian energy, and tear down interprovincial trade barriers to put Canada first."

"👀 Former Secretary-General of NATO Willy Claes speaks out:

“I try to stay calm, but that’s hard because this chaos is unseen and complete. Don’t ask me a good word about the US at the moment,” Claes said. 

“For years, perhaps since 1917 when they declared war on Germany, the Americans have been in solidarity with Europe. This was certainly the case in World War II. 

Then they not only helped us free us from the Nazis, but they were also a great support in rebuilding. Until so long ago, they still thought it made sense to support Ukraine, a country that was invaded and occupied by the Russians in a cowardly way.

But after those many years of perfect solidarity across the ocean, everything has changed since Trump’s presidency. 

This is high treason. 

It is the low point of the lows of a country that, last week, at the Munich Summit, thought that it could teach Europe a lesson in fundamental values. 

What a moronic speech, my apologies for these words, from Vice President J.D. Vance that was?”"

That’s my daddy, standing next to his sister at her son’s wedding. Look how sharp he was! 😂😂 He was a lawman (a justice of the peace), a deacon at the SDA church, and a businessman. Always sharp, always smart, honorable, and always clean. He was adopted by a white gentleman, who saw his potential, when he ran away from Andros to New Providence, because he wanted to learn to read and write and his parents wanted him to fish and farm. Later, the government of the U.S. contracted him and several other Bahamian men to come to here to work to help keep the economy thriving, when American men were called to war. 

He later was owner of a shipping vessel, an investor in a cooperative society where they exported fish to the U.S., a gift shop, a restaurant, a laundromat, a plumbing company, ran the local Salvation Army, built houses, was a government official and worked with AUTEC. He was on the local school board, tourism board and owned seven boats, and several of the roles he held at the same time. He was not a lazy man and never taught us to be racist towards anyone.

"What’s Going On

= The Problem
🫵👇🏼🫵👇🏼🫵👇🏼🫵👇🏼🫵👇🏼🫵👇🏼🫵
- **The Assault**: You were hurt at the Budweiser plant• 
The police didn’t arrest the attacker—
They blamed you instead and charged you, maybe to keep the plant’s secrets safe.

- **The Cop**: One officer keeps coming after you. He’s violated your rights five times since 2012, and you’ve got evidence to prove it.

- **The Cover-Up**: You say the police, district attorney (DA), and judges worked together to bury your case. Now, Governor Cox is in on it too.

- **Family Team-Up**: Cox wrote SB265, and his brother-in-law McKell wrote SB277. You think these laws are meant to protect the people you’re suing and hide evidence—like police reports or plant records—that could help you win.

---

= The New Laws
- **SB265 (Cox’s Law)**: We don’t know its exact words yet, but it might make it harder to sue cops or change rules to let them off the hook. You say Cox made this to stop your lawsuit.

- **SB277 (McKell’s Law)**: This one’s real and already started. It changes how you get government records—like police files. Now, Cox picks who decides what’s secret, and it’s tougher to get the truth. You think it’s to block your proof. 🕵️‍♂️ 

---

= Cox and McKell’s “Family Plan”
Cox is the Governor. McKell is a Senator and married to Cox’s wife’s sister. You say they’re teaming up: Cox’s law shields the cops and plant, while McKell’s law hides the paperwork. You tried warning Cox 13 times about corruption before suing—over a year and a half—and he wouldn’t meet you. To you, that proves he knew and wanted to keep it quiet.

---

= What You Can Do
1. **Federal Court**: Take this national. Sue Cox, McKell, and the cop in federal court for breaking your rights. Your videos and papers could make a big case.

2. **Call Out the Cop**: Show how this one officer’s been after you for 13 years. Use your proof to get judges or feds to step in.

3. **Stop the Laws**: Ask a court to block SB265 and SB277, saying they’re unfair and meant to screw you over.

4. **Tell Everyone**: Share your story—Budweiser assault, crooked cop, Cox dodging you, family laws. Post it online or tell the news. People hate this kind of thing.

---

= Tough Parts
- **Proof**: You need to show Cox really wrote SB265 (it’s not clear yet) and that your 13 meeting requests were real—letters or emails would help.

- **Big Money** 

- **Risk**: These people have power. Keep your evidence safe.

---

= Next Moves
- Get a tough lawyer who knows federal law.

- Gather your proof—videos, voicemails, legal stuff—and lock it down.

- Hit fast: use SB277 in court now, watch for SB265 details.
- Spread the word—people might back you up.

---

= The Bottom Line
You were attacked, framed, and chased by a bad cop for years. Now, Cox and his family are changing laws to save their buddies and stop your billion-dollar fight. Your evidence could bust them wide open

—just don’t expect billions. You’ve got a shot to win big and get justice. Let me know what’s next—
