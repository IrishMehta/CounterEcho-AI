@MeaneyJim @gpjqd2vnfd @CTVNews There's such a thing as right-sizing your base load grid and peaker plants (usually LNG). So you're essentially OK with burning LNG to make up the difference, because this added demand is only a fraction of the year

Natural gas. Meta's embraced it, xAI has some too, but their mix of power is a bit more hodgepodge apparently, and others vary but most of the focus is on natural gas. Primarily that's because on the timescales to build a power plant, a natural gas plant is a lot faster than a nuclear plant.

@Jimmywonton2 It is my BP. but I didn’t drink. I did something worse. And I just put two and two together. I had fast food for dinner 3 nights in a row because of working late with the young guys at work. Holy shit. am probably full of sodium.
@roadsafety RoSPA probably has their proper meetings in an underground carpark with executives from BP, Shell and Ford to think up ways to divert public energy into road safety strategies that maximise their profits. How about no mandatory insurance and tax for cars limited to 20mph?
@joshrecollet @The_Truth_II @Mollyploofkins Manufacturing won’t come back to the US because manufacturers don’t want to pay the higher wages for US workers compared to the minuscule wages in other countries.

You are unable to use another mouth to eat food you are never permitted to eat with your own mouth. If you aren't welcome at that table, you really shouldn't assume you get to be a Ghost in that Shell. If the White House is without a cheering section at his table, so are we.
Received about 1.4 million from donors, who worked for pharmaceutical/health product industry according to various sources. A shell game by any other name... We're all big boys. It's obvious to everyone, spend any time looking. What's amazing to me is that the very same people who spend all their lives as politicians are the ones who have benefited the most.

Yes indeed every branch of government and each and every managing director of these said shell companies that work for government those are precious I’m certain. Government and other entities who owe us money we need to call in those balances and not give them a choice, they can either pay it back or fold its business. It’s corruption all the way around
Everything the government does with canadian taxes, including the secret shell companies that are hidden from the public as nonprofit entities. Canada has not had real transparency in decades.  We, as Canadian people, need to know what exactly the government is doing with our money. I don't recognize Canada anymore.

"During WWI, 'shell shock' was a term used to describe what we now recognize as PTSD, affecting many soldiers mentally. The soldier in the image likely experienced severe psychological stress, a common issue due to the intense and prolonged combat conditions of WWI. The French military, like many others, initially misunderstood shell shock, often mistaking it for cowardice, leading to harsh disciplinary measures.
Treatment for shell shock during WWI included rest, removal from the front lines, and sometimes controversial methods like electrotherapy, with varying degrees of success. The recognition of shell shock as a legitimate medical condition marked a significant shift in how mental health was perceived in military contexts."

"Washing an egg means letting bacteria inside the shell. Germs on the shell could enter the egg and contaminate the food. Since the shell is porous, washing allows bacteria to pass from the outside to the inside. In the shell there is salmonellosis, a bacteria that can kill a person, so we don't wash eggs.
a dry cloth is more than enough"

You could write books on this one, and there probably are many books on the subject. In a nut shell, I would create a long and detailed list of characteristics, starting with physical, then mental, some psychological, and then go to externals-type and model care the character would drive, the place that character lives in, the clothes worn, etc. Some even advocate conducting an interview with them, creating a long list of questions to as and then supplying the answers from the would-be character. And then pick a movie star who could play this character of the story was filmed. You get the idea. Do the work necessary to see your character as a real person.

"Typically it’s $35k-$40k at this event so split between 4 projects it’s $10k each. Which is about the going rate for a 3x3m booth.

There’s always variance depending on things like “premium location” extras or raw space vs shell scheme vs bespoke stand build etc… 

The benefit of being on a “pavilion” is that by grouping everyone together, you have a better chance of being noticed as opposed to having say 4 seperate Cardano projects in 3x3m booths spread across the exhibition hall. That approach normally means you get lost in the noise of everyone around you.

@Ora_Tyl @KhulaniQoma The EU will never allow Russia to invade anybody with the continent, sanctions are ravaging Russian gas revenue. This is bilateral meeting and it doesn't involve NATO and Ukraine, will it succeed? Secondly, if Russia openly agree that they are suffering, they will be conceding.

@P_Kallioniemi NordStream-2 came into existence after russia annexed #Crimea and parts of Donetsk. So, EU always wants cheap russian gas. The day peace agreement is signed, next day EU will go back to buying from russia.
@CarlZha Actually, corrupt German politicians made the company dependent on Russian energy
And why can we do this and get away with it? Because European energy is still stronger than the Russian energy. If the Russian cultural energy was stronger then they could decide. But they can't.
What he’s really saying is: “Trump shut down USAID. This is how we were able to launder a ton of money. The EU has decided that we can keep laundering if we keep this senseless war going so that’s what we’re considering.” “also, if Ukraine doesn’t have this war there will be an election and I will no longer be in power, and I’d rather stay in power than save Ukrainian life”.

@Stephan9015 @IAPonomarenko The election is not about choosing sides between Russia and Ukraine, but the AfD clearly advocates stopping aid to Ukraine and resuming the purchase of Russian gas. Buying Russian gas directly funds their efforts to rebuild military strength. It doesn’t lead to a longlasting peac
@donaldtusk Europe is still buying Russian gas...
@simon_schama Trump told Europe hard truths they needed to hear about building up NATO and not relying on Russian gas the last time he was president. They laughed and smirked. Biden came along and Russia invades Ukraine. Russian gas disappears and now they’re crying it’s Trump’s fault.
"@berlin_bridge I'm sorry, but Europe os threatened by Russia because leaded by Germany, Europe pursued a wrong policy of dependance on Russian energy (although East Europe warned it was a bad idea).
Europe is threatened by Russia because when the fucking dwarf threatened Europe in 2007"
@harmless_human @visegrad24 The Cold War ended in the early 90s. In the last 30 to 35 years, we didn’t need to defend ourselves from Russia. Instead, Russian gas has provided us with enormous economic advantages over the past decades.
Lord Greg Barker: A former Conservative MP, Lord Barker served as the executive chairman of En+ Group, a Russian energy company, from 2017 until his resignation in 2022.
"@medanielkennedy @ChassNews Fixed it for you 
🇩🇪
✅ Cuts down all import of Russian gas
✅ Spent 100 billion Eur extra to strengthen the military 
✅ 2nd largest supplier of Ukraine 
Also 🇩🇪: The 🇺🇸 is undermining 🇪🇺 security"
It’s Europe that’s distracted and divided, idiot. He’s warning close allies to get their houses in order before they can focus on anything else. And he’s right, jut as Trump was right when he warned Germany over 4 years ago not to be dependent on Russian energy, and they snickered at him. How did that work out?
"the eu spent the 1st month post invasion bickering about which luxury goods were going to be exempt from the sanction regime.

germany refused re-export licences on lepeord ones for the best part of a year. they only stopped using russian gas because someone blew up the pipeline.

europeans have no right to the high ground over ukraine."
@CollinRugg Little german cry baby Pistorius, you and your country have jeopardized European security and economy AGAIN. This time by shutting down nuclear power plants and opening up Europe for Russian gas
@SanchoPanzy @Rsalasor @ForecasterEnten Inflation happened because the war broke out in Ukraine and Biden put sanction on Russian energy causing gas prices to skyrocket.
"@JrLarryW @Pocketlint @cosmepolitics We're not in the EU mate, and we're not buying any Russian energy. It's actually illegal in the UK to do any business with Russia.

And, yes, I hope we do undermine Trump on this, because he's conceding to Putin. He's weak. 

Bit dodgy, that."
"Economic Apocalypse 💸📉  

- U.S.: Dollar dominance ends; BRICS nations push a gold-backed currency.  
- Europe: Deindustrializes without Russian gas. Unemployment hits 30%.

@charliekirk11 Germans reacted pretty bad when Trump warned they're deppending on Russian gas, the reality became in tge form of a record high heating bill. Now, Germany government, in a auditorium full of EU bureacrats reacts to VP Vance. They never learn.
@DashaBurns Reminds me of when Germany laughed as Trump for saying they were too reliant on Russian energy.  Then they found out he was right.  Europeans are pompous fools in general.
@EvanCull @MoormannRainer We can get the same from Russia. We even had pipelines from Russia - which was necessary due to green Energiewende. (Oh, and the greens led us to more dependencies to Russian gas by lying about the nuclear plants, and they switched them off)
@robin_j_brooks And if then Belgium closes its port for Russian LNG transfer it’s over with Putins income and with the war. Russia is about to crumble. Let’s push them over, reclaim Ukraine and divide all of Russia West of Volga into independent European states. Afuera Putin!
"@juliavkril The way to victory for Ukraine is to increase energy sales to all nations who buy Russia energy and sanction all nations who buy Russian energy… until they end the war if Ukrainian invasion.

But Biden could not do that because the Greenies would dump him."

"Shell, do you ever think that sending such pictures could be terribly dysphoria-inducing for some people?

I know several transsexual males who have said they can’t be on forums meant for trans men because transgender mascs constantly ramble about female biology—talking about being female, vaginas, pregnancy—and that it just feels like any typical girl forum, except almost everyone has a beard.

This only further suggests that transgenders are just cissexuals who are very comfortable with their natal bodies and gonads, with little respect for actual transsexuals."
"Transgenderism has the same outcome as TERFism for transsexuals—both chain us to birth-registered categories and deny sex affirmation.

Transgenderism is play-pretend; it’s not about being a certain sex—it’s gender anarchy.

It’s like how a trans masc woman like Shell in my country was trying to divide AMABs and AFABs into different groups. She could have just missexed directly and said, ‘Boys on this side (including feminine boys)’ and ‘Girls on this side (including masculine boys),’ because that’s exactly what they mean."

"Hubby got really sick a couple weeks ago & passed out and hit his head pretty good. Couple days later we had to call 911 for him because he was blacking out again and really weak. Ambulance came, BP 174/128. Took him to the ER & dumped him in the waiting room behind everyone else. He could barely stand up or walk. It's a good thing he had me to help him get into the triage room because that stupid girl just stood there staring at him while I had to drag him to the chair to get his BP again because it was like we never got there in an ambulance. She didn't even offer to help or get us a wheelchair, just stood their looking like a dumbass.

Then when the Dr comes in... first thing he does is make fun of RFKjr. He says, ""Sorry, I've been sick & now I sound like RFKjr so bear with me""..... like WTF? Was that really necessary? Was he sizing us up for our political views? 

That's not the first bad experience we've had here, it's just the most recent bad experience we've had here.

I am so disappointed in the local care we receive."

That low cost was something I did not expect - but that said, they are not without nasty side effects. I'd choose diet (even if it cost me more) over a drug every time. Not that I won't take a drug if needed; my stress level is high and I'm on a BP med currently. But will work to get off it - just not at the expense of high BP.

I take eggs to my family all the time. My niece was eating duck eggs for close to a year when one day she asked why the one eggs looked a bit different and seemed to have a harder shell. I was shocked at how much she freaked out learning they were duck eggs. Even though she could not tell the difference she would not take any more duck eggs. She totally refused to try turkey eggs even though they are just like a huge chicken. Lol Turkey eggs were pretty much the same to me. made great hardboiled eggs.

@Earthjustice Natural gas much more green than solar or wind. Mining of heavy metals and all the concrete needed for each short lived windmill is detrimental to our planet. School yourselves and stop gaslighting America.
@jackmallers Sec State Kiss. betrayed usa by making oil backing dollar it should have been a basket of many commodities that usa was rich in, gold, wheat, corn, natural gas, etc also senate making china favored nation in 1999 was mistake.
"@bertden3 @THEMightlyMouse @MBDan7 Trudeau chased away over 500 billion in investment in our resource sector. He claimed there was no business case for shipping our LNG to Europe. 

You are just wrong. And he bought the pipeline because HE CHASED AWAY THE PRIVATE SECTOR"
@NChartierET If there’s no social acceptability for a pipeline then the same should be said about the money generated by what goes through through those pipelines 🤷‍♀️
@DrJacobsRad As i have suggested previously for LNG Cornwall would be the place. New industry.
@Canadian4truth1 @theJagmeetSingh Because we selling our natural gas. Who do you think the world is going to buy from first? The USA provides too much to everyone’s economy to not be first choice. We don’t care either way. We can easily be self reliant and f¥ck the rest.
@NChartierET The tankers sail up the St Lawrence to Montreal, and the Natural gas pipeline ends in Quebec City. Politically it happens, and politically it stops there because Quebec runs the Country and could care less about any wealth for Atlantic Canada, because their $13B is guaranteed.
@SelinaThePagan 1) Millstone is basically end-of-life, propped up by 100s of million$ GOP pushed thru legislature that we're paying for and MA consumption is big reason why.
"SAR says we need #WindFirst to lower GHG emissions: invest in zero-emission wind propulsion in vessels and not turn to dirty ""solutions"" such as LNG which emits methane, a gas 80 times more potent than CO2. #EMTER reveals that Rotor sails can achieve fuel savings of up to 30%"
@momomahasees @Hootnanny9 @RoadDawg2022 @jimsciutto The EU needs new energy sources, although AB oil doesn't have a viable transport option right now Newfoundland oil does. LNG needs to grow and can go to the same markets. Intra-provincial trade can be made easier. And there are more options to explore other then the US
@SelinaThePagan I was never a fan of nuclear power, but I have changed my mind as I learn about the pros/cons.
@kpac_15 If Que doesn't want Energy East then it should be re-routed to the Sarnia refineries. If Que doesn't want pipelines then that can be remedied by terminating Line 9 at the Que border. Que can get it's motor fuel by rail or cargo ships and make do without natural gas.
"@brianlilley Why do you stir up the past? We can use that opportunity as a country to bring down the rhetoric and finally move forward.

@JenniferScalis7 @kate_p45 Canada send 4 million barrels of oil per day to the US. 98% of US natural gas imports, 28% of US uranium imports and a massive amount of hydro. You have a big country that needs energy. This is why there is a trade deficit. It’s not like you can go without these things
@AntIfaInUrCity @MichaelBerrySho The United States is the world's largest natural gas producer in the world, producing 755.8 billion cubic meters.

@David_Moscrop That is why Trudeau has signed a deal with Poland for Uranium, a deal with Ecuador and Peru. That is why he has been visiting Indo Asian countries. These things don't get done overnight but he has been putting in the work and doing exactly that.
@strikerglows @Trevor_McHaney @Banana3Stocks Lng does not provide petrol. Every thing you gloss over as “easy” clearly is not because Canada built a complex network of pipelines into the US to circumvent their lack of ability to refine. You really do not know what you are talking about here.
"@al1_donny @jimpfaff Oil, coal, natural gas - most likely. It's our largest import.

Also, saying that creating a shortage of 1.5 million cars would only be a blip is foolish. 

Further, the cars will still come. You'll just pay more for your car, even if you buy domestic."
"3rd largest oil reserves. US 11th.
5th largest natural gas.
Vast forests.
1st in Potash. (States already said it will add costs to food.)

You pay the tariff not us. You buy 20% of your daily oil supply so gas prices will go up.

We will be fine. Our dollar at 80 cents is best for us.

Trump wants Trudeau gone, don't blame him. 😀"
@Mg60615160 @Trevor_McHaney @Banana3Stocks Gas is the first priority with the new BC LNG facility coming online soon. Refining as an investment wasn't needed but is easily obtainable. Tariffs increase global pricing making shipping costs easier to support. Basically all we are talking is delays while fuel is rerouted

@Mikeyboyjets I’m not wrong though. Ask the people in the northern states how they feel about receiving notices today in the dead of winter that their heating bills are going up effective immediately because of the new tariff in natural gas.
@JustAMan37 @LoblawsON However, Canada exports about 50% of its natural gas to the U.S., so if anything gets more expensive, it’ll be Americans eating cold fish.
@TrumpDailyPosts Canada buys more from the United States than any other country does. If the energy sector—oil, natural gas, and electricity—is not included in calculations, the U.S. has had a trade surplus with Canada for the last sixteen years straight.

@bmore_ray52 @TheBWoah @EricLDaugh Ok. Look at high quality oil, natural gas, and still hydroelectric. All needed for energy and manufacturing here. If Canada does handouts it will be to offset the cost to their citizens. They can literally jack up prices by 500%. We have no other sources.

(even though 90s 2008 and 2014 happened). THIS is the TRUE price of capitalism.
@elonmusk Party that wants to be friends with Putin in order to have cheep gas from Russia is not a good option.
@Timbo_tigger @Euunul @logvynenko The best thing for Europe would be to make peace with Russia. Turn on the gas and go back to being a world competitor. Right now, they hitched their horses onto a fail sanction regime. Its hurting them more than Russia, who has seen growth for several straight quarters.

What’s next? Joint buying for hydrogen in September, followed by critical minerals &amp; gas later this year. Europe’s energy landscape is changing fast!
@IcemanJRD @globalnews I guess Elon will have to stop saving America and get a second job at the gas station. How will he ever survive?
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Europe has been OVER restrictive while America has been UNDER. Newly confirmed health secretary (DHHS) RFK Jr  will surely strike the fine balance I mean, not just additives as dye extract from petro but preservatives as well like carbon monoxide n nitrogen gas to ex' shelf life
@Appalachian1010 @_rathbone Hitler did the same propaganda that the Jews that he put into the gas chambers are agressors, not peaceful protestors. Most of the fascism today are not as extreme as Nazism (closest one is in Israel), but they still require military and police dispatch under Biden and Trump.
@AlexTaylorNews Europe is lost, fighting Russia by implementing socialism which is basically communism is like putting out a fire with gas
@MAGAVoice There is no gulf of America we still have paper straws taxpayers paid for that trip to the Superbowl don't care about alleged hostages still paying over 3 dollars for gas and still have GMO'S in food   more lies @MAGAVoice I see
"The days of America being everyone's piggy bank and NATO members not carrying their weight are over.
Had you guys been paying your fair share since 1991 you wouldn't have a problem.
Trump told Germany many years ago they were making huge mistake cozying up to Russia for their gas and they literally laughed at him.
Now he is trolling them to get them to do something and it's working"
"@ypma_albert @helenestafleu Europeans are so naive. They bought US propaganda about ""democracy"" and ""the Russian threat"". The US forced EU to buy expensive US oil, gas, and weapons, weakened EU economy, and now takes Ukraine's riches while saying EU should buy huge amount of US weapons."
@BillyBaldwin Call it what it is . Gulf Of America. America First mother fuckers. https://t.co/FcL9ag3xKm
"@iShootRopes69 Who owns our ass 😂 
60% of your minerals and gas come from Canada and at a heavy discount. 
We will just sell to other countries at full price.
Canada doesn't need your processed foods and we make cars in canada.
What else does America have oh that's right nothing
We own you 😂"
"@adumbasswitsass @2covet @muhammadshehad2 Negotiate better conditions? Dude, Israel is a colonial settler project that wants the Palestinians gone in order to grab more land &amp; steal their natural resources (the gas/oil in sea in front of Gaza), that's what the ""war"" is all about. Did the Native Americans get better..."
@HoisenHsoj @mathshsh @abu_imran_m @Fx1Jonny Preventing them from leaving Gaza is a crime against humanity. Imposing living conditions that restrict births is genocide. You don't get to trivialize what Israel has done to Gazans. Just because you allow them wifi and don't use a gas chamber, doesn't mean you're not monsters. https://t.co/Bp2IxAlWYa
@guyverhofstadt I'm not buying this false flag. if Russia wanted to damage Chernobyl, they would have done it properly. This was a deep-state operation carried out by Ukraine.
"@Reges_official Gas , oil , Solid minerals mined for free in the north ...

If you followed Trump campaign you will see where he said we will open our oil wells and mine our beautiful oil in America...."
"@LetsStopC9 @AkibD4r I wonder, was Zelensky a useful idiot or, did he really believe that he could beat Russia. Did the U.S. with the help of the U.K. gas him up into believing that he really stood a chance of winning with their “help”.
When the U.S. comes knocking, slam the door shut!✌🏽"
"@Damocleansword Russia 🇷🇺 backing Niger 🇳🇪 is a big slap on Nigeria 🇳🇬 
Occupying Niger 🇳🇪 means Nigeria 🇳🇬 cannot continue with the construction of our gas pipeline to Europe (🇳🇬 is losing revenue be she can’t sell gas to Europe) 
Occupying Niger 🇳🇪 means Europe is dependent on Russia 🇷🇺 gas."
@McFaul And the US must repaer the Northstream pipeline IMMEDIATELY so the Netherlands and Germany get cheap gas from Russia again to prevent their economy breaks down.The US damaged that pipeline and forced us to buy gas from the US.Biden was NOT our friend and Putin is NOT our ennemy!
@ISmileydog @URBVNTURBAN @amvetsupport Very easy to point these out, but never bring up 16 million jobs created(the most of any president), record low inflation post Covid 2%, more gas being made in America, and btw the taxes u we’re paying under Biden were to account for trumps tax cuts from back then, It ends 2025
"@BohuslavskaKate Most of Europe neglected their own defenses because they counted on the US (and often LAUGHED at the US because ""those stupid Americans waste so much money with weapons that they don't have healthcare"").... well well well... https://t.co/jo9Ef72peh"
@AndrewTrip41 @itsdeaann You mean when gas was pushing $4 a gallon in 2022, the year when Russia invaded Ukraine, and every country was placing sanctions on Russia which caused pretty much every country in the world to have high gas prices+have to rethink their oil. That sure was because of Biden!
@BULLReturns Not really, Putin would have just found another excuse. He can't allow eastern Ukraine oil and gas fields to be commercialised, as that will be the economic death of Russia
"Because it costs money and military resources to protect a country so USA must evaluate in every case what is the cost benefit and if it costs more than the benefit to the American economy and strategic interests then we don’t defend a country. 

How long have you lived in Ukraine?"
